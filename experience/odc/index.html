When interns are accepted in the program, they’re divided into teams that compete against each other in this challenge (and internship) for the next 4 months. The goal is to work on innovative projects in the edition’s theme. During my participation, the theme was AiOT: Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things: A Winning Duo to Tackle the Challenges of Tomorrow! From Brainstorming to pitching the final product on stage, the journey is nothing short of exciting. Hard work, discipline, team work, collaboration, innovation, creativity, coding, problem-solving, critical thinking, public speaking and more are essential skills to win this challenge. This program is in collaboration with AWS and EY who provide mentorship and support throughout the entire program.\nKey Achievements and Responsibilities Selected from 23 interns out of 1300 candidates:\nOne of 23 interns, and one of 3 AI and data science selected profils from 1300 applicants through rigorous hiring process. Demonstrated proficiency in Python, R, SQL, ML, DL, algorithms, cloud computing, leadership, problem-solving and teamwork. 3rd place Orange Summer Challenge Prize:\nSecured 3rd place in the competition. Pitched our project infront of hundreds of people including ministers, directors, chiefs from AWS, EY and Orange, investors, professors amoung many. Achieved a high accuracy rate demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, solve complex problems, and deliver impactful results. Led a team of 6 as Scrum Master, boosting efficiency by 20%:\nAs a Scrum Master, I led a cross-functional team of six increasing efficiency by 20% through agile sprints. Utilized Jira for project management. Conducted daily stand-ups, sprint planning sessions, and retrospectives and facilitated open communication and continuous improvement within the team. Mentored team members on agile best practices, fostering a collaborative and high-performing team environment. Managed AWS account for a 30% latency reduction:\nServed as Cloud Team Leader to manage our team’s AWS account, optimizing our cloud infrastructure by implementing autoscaling groups, optimizing instance types, and leveraging Elastic Load Balancing to reduce latency by 30% and improve performance. Utilized AWS services such as EC2 for scalable computing, RDS for managed relational databases, and CloudFront for content delivery. Utilized AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment. Employed AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance issues. These optimizations significantly enhanced the responsiveness and efficiency of our applications, leading to a better user experience. Built improved Machine Learning models, achieving 15% accuracy increase:\nImproved model accuracy by 15% through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, and implemented feature selection techniques to enhance model performance and feature selection. Used Python libraries (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow) and ensemble methods (bagging, boosting). My work involved rigorous cross-validation to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. Utilized Python for data preprocessing and feature engineering, and AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment. Demonstrated my deep understanding of machine learning techniques and my ability to drive significant improvements through systematic experimentation and optimization through iterations and continuous improvements of the models. Designed and managed data pipelines, orchestrating data flow from diverse sources through batch and streaming workflows:\nDesigned and managed robust data pipelines to handle data from diverse sources, ensuring seamless data flow and integration. Using Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and Apache Airflow for batch processing, I orchestrated complex workflows that handled data ingestion, transformation, and loading. Employed ETL tools such as Talend and AWS Glue for data transformation and utilized Amazon S3 for scalable storage solutions. By implementing monitoring and logging solutions with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), I ensured real-time visibility into data pipeline performance. This enabled timely troubleshooting and optimization, supporting real-time analytics and data-driven decision-making processes. Participated in meetings with Orange, EY and AWS managers and mentors\nParticipated in weekly meetings with Orange managers to discuss the project’s advancements, needs, and future steps. Conducted regular meetings with AWS and EY experts for updates, mentorship and support. Conducted in-dept research:\nDeveloped a dataset for predicting movement, activity, and posture using sensor-equipped insoles. Collaborated with a medical doctor to ensure data relevance and comprehensiveness. Refined models through feature engineering and machine learning techniques. Pitched the project and advertised it\nParticipated in many shootings for the project such as the demo video and the teaser video. Wrote the script of the videos, and did the voice-over. Participated in many shootings for the program’s social media platforms including the “Can you guess our solution?” video. Pitched our solution infront of ministers, directors, chiefs from AWS, EY and Orange, investors, professors amoung many, on stage and in the stand. Through these experiences, I have developed a comprehensive skill set in cloud computing, data science, machine learning, and agile methodologies. My ability to apply these skills to real-world challenges demonstrates my technical mastery and my commitment to delivering high-impact solutions.\n",
