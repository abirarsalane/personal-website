# Description
**Research Data Scientist at Electric Vehicle Insurance Startup**

I was interning as a research data scientist at a startup in Paris specializing in insurance for electric vehicles that was honored as the Coup de Coeur Climate Finance Fund at the Fintech For Tomorrow challenge and is part of the prestigious FrenchTech Grand Paris. My role focused on developing a scoring system to evaluate and incentivize eco-friendly driving behaviors. This score determined driver eligibility for awards based on their eco-responsibility. 

# Key Responsibilities and Achievements
## Developing the Eco-Responsibility Score
- **Score Formulation:**
    - Designed a comprehensive formula to calculate a driver’s eco-responsibility score, reflecting their energy consumption and driving efficiency.
    - Conducted extensive research in physics, energy consumption, and factors affecting electric vehicle performance to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- Integrated variables such as speed, acceleration, braking patterns, route topology, and weather conditions into the scoring algorithm.
## Research and Data Analysis
- **Interdisciplinary Research:**
    - Delved into various domains, including mathematics, climate science, and energy consumption.
    - Read and analyzed numerous research papers to gather insights and data.
    - Contacted dataset authors for additional information to supplement my models.
- **Data Mining and Model Development:**
    - Sourced and curated datasets relevant to driving patterns and energy usage from sources like telematics data and public databases.
    - Performed data cleaning and imputation to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
    - Enhanced modeling accuracy by 15% through advanced data mining techniques and feature engineering.
    - Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and statistical methods to derive meaningful insights from the data.
    - Scraped the web for detailed consumption data of various electric vehicle models based on brand, series, and other specifications.
## Implementation and Impact
- **Integration and Deployment:**
    - Successfully integrated the eco-responsibility score into the company’s services and products.
    - Developed API endpoints and user interfaces to make the score accessible to end-users and integrate seamlessly with existing systems.
    - The scoring system is actively used by end-users, contributing to the company’s offerings.
- **Cross-disciplinary Collaboration:**
    - Worked closely with teams across different disciplines to ensure a holistic approach to the project.
    - Collaborated with software engineers to ensure efficient and scalable implementation of the scoring algorithm.
    - Boosted energy efficiency by 25% with innovative eco-driving modules, achieving a 20% accuracy improvement in driving behavior prediction.
- **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Conducted iterative testing and refinement of the scoring algorithm to adapt to new data and improve performance.
    - Utilized feedback from real-world usage to make ongoing enhancements to the model.
    - Employed version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage code changes and maintain a robust development workflow.
## Technical Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:**
    - Python (for data analysis, modeling, and algorithm development)
    - R (for statistical analysis)
- **Data Handling and Processing:**
    - Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
    - Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for machine learning)
    - SQL (for database queries and management)
- **Web Scraping:**
    - BeautifulSoup, Scrapy (for extracting vehicle consumption data from the web)
- **Deployment:**
    - Docker (for containerization)
- **Visualization and Reporting:**
    - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
    - Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive analysis and reporting)


Through this experience, I developed a deep understanding of the intersection between data science and sustainable practices in the context of electric vehicle insurance. My work not only advanced the company’s product offerings but also promoted eco-friendly driving behaviors, aligning with broader environmental goals.
