# Sorbonne University

What a journey has it been! Last semester was one of the most challenging yet exciting semesters I’ve ever had. It was full of ups and downs, adventures, challenges, opportunities but more importantly knowledge.

I’ve learnt so much and grown so much and I can’t even begin to explain how enriching my experience at Sorbonne Université has been. I met amazing people, worked with brilliant students and learned from the best professors.

I’m so proud to have been a student at one of the most prestigious universities in France and the world.

I am beyond proud and honoured to have had the chance to be enrolled in the program Licence d’informatique at Sorbonne Université that is ranked #1 in the “licence d’informatique” programs ( bachelors of computer science) in France (according to the Classement Eduniversal des meilleurs Licences, Bachelors et Grandes Écoles).

This experience was enriching on so many levels. I had the chance to take very intersting classes such as 'Bioinformatics' where I learnt a lot about biology and how to implement computer science and specifically data science to solve biology challenges. I have also had the opportunity to be part of many interesting events such as the 4EU+ Alliance event where I had the pleasure to represente Sorbonne University among 6 other european universities (Because you know Youth has a voice and I'll gladly be it!). I was also a referee at the France Cup of Robotis which was a ONE-OF-A-KIND experience. And other than professional experiences, I was also part of many cultural events. One of them was the 'Emily in Paris' tour when I, with otehr international students, explored the places where the series were filmed.

All in all, it was an incredible experience and I'm so thankful to have had these opportunities.

I’m so thrilled and excited for what’s coming next!
