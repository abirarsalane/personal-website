# Innovation Meets Impact: My Journey with Orange Summer Challenge 2023
Can you imagine a day where innovation meets social impact? I had the privilege of living it on October 17th, 2023, as we celebrated the culmination of the Orange Summer Challenge 2023. This prestigious program brought together brilliant minds from 15 countries across the Orange Digital Centers network, uniting our collective vision to shape the future. üåç

This year, the Orange Summer Challenge revolved around the theme "Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things: A Winning Duo to Tackle the Challenges of Tomorrow!" It was an extraordinary opportunity to dive into cutting-edge technologies and harness their potential to make a lasting impact.

Throughout this transformative journey, we were fortunate to be supported by a strong system provided by Orange , Amazon Web Services (AWS) and EY . The guidance, mentorship, and personalized training we received were instrumental in our growth and development. Our mission was clear: to foster innovation and create meaningful solutions in crucial areas.

But what truly made this experience exceptional was the amazing team I had the honor of working with. Their talent, ambition, and dedication were the driving forces behind our success. ‚ú®

# The pitch
At the heart of the challenge, I had the privilege of representing my team and pitching our project. Months of hard work, innovation, and unwavering dedication culminated in the unveiling of our project - Scia-tech, a revolutionary smart insole designed to seamlessly integrate into daily life.

# The project
Picture this: smart insoles that not only monitor your every move but also provide a unique solution for those dealing with sciatica. Our insoles go beyond tracking; they analyze your posture and behaviors to identify patterns that could lead to sciatica pain. What sets us apart is a cutting-edge recommendation system offering a personalized and unique user experience through a mobile app. 

# Why it matters
**Numbers don't lie:**
- +70% PATIENTS live with sciatica pain for more than 10 years. 
- +1.2 BILLION ‚Ç¨ spent on sciatica related expenses. 
- +8 MILLION people are affected by sciatica in Morocco only. 
- +30% PATIENTS suffer from sciatica in the world.

**Daily Challenges:**
- High prevalence of sciatica affecting a large population.
- Economic impact costing billions of euros annually in healthcare.
- Challenges in managing activities.
- Lack of personalized care.
- Mobility limitations.

# More than just an AI Project
Throughout this internship, I've had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse range of individuals - from fellow interns and dedicated supervisors to mentors who have guided me every step of the way. This experience also opened doors for me to interact with top-level directors and even the government minister of Economic Inclusion, Small Business, Employment and Skills Mr. Sekkouri Youness, allowing me to pitch in front of a diverse and influential audience, and pushing me to grow and expand my horizons in unexpected ways.

However, the beauty of this internship extends beyond the workplace. It's also about forging genuine connections and building meaningful relationships. Beyond projects and tasks, I've been fortunate to connect with amazing individuals and create lasting friendships. It's a testament to the fact that professional growth is intrinsically tied to the people you meet and the experiences you share.
