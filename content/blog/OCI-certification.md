# OCI Generative AI Professional Certification
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2024 Generative AI Professional course caters to Software Developers, Machine Learning/AI Engineers, and Gen AI Professionals. It offers an in-depth technical introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs), covering various aspects such as LLM architecture, fine-tuning techniques, code models, multimodal LLMs, and language agents. Additionally, the course covers topics like pretrained foundational models, summarization, embeddings, Dedicated AI Clusters, and the OCI Generative AI security architecture.Throughout the course, participants will engage in practical exercises, including building a conversational chatbot using the OCI Generative AI service. They will learn to enhance the chatbot's conversational abilities by integrating memory and implementing RAG with LangChain. Finally, students will gain experience deploying the chatbot on an OCI compute instance.
