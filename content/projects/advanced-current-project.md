- **Gradio**: A library for creating interactive user interfaces for machine learning models, simplifying deployment and usage.
- **scikit-learn**: Utilized for data splitting, evaluation metrics, and other utility functions.

## Models Used

- **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**: A versatile model from Hugging Face capable of performing various NLP tasks by framing them as text-to-text problems.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A pre-trained model from Hugging Face used for understanding the context within text, essential for tasks like text classification and entity recognition.
- **GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4)**: An advanced model used for text generation tasks, capable of producing human-like text based on the given input.

## Datasets

- **Common Crawl**: A vast and diverse web corpus that provides extensive training data, ensuring the model learns from a wide variety of text.
- **Custom Web Scraped Data**: Additional data collected through web scraping from multiple websites to enrich the training dataset and improve model robustness.

## Methodologies

### Data Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Implementing techniques to remove HTML tags, special characters, and normalize text to lower case, ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Augmentation**: Employing methods such as back-translation (translating text to another language and back), synonym replacement, and noise injection to enhance data diversity and model generalization.
- **Tokenization**: Using SentencePiece for subword tokenization, enabling better handling of rare words and improving the model's understanding of text.

### Model Training and Fine-Tuning
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Utilizing half-precision floating-point format to speed up training and reduce memory usage, facilitated by frameworks like PyTorch.
- **Distributed Training**: Leveraging multiple GPUs to parallelize training, significantly reducing training time and improving efficiency.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Optuna**: Conducting hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, systematically exploring the hyperparameter space to identify the optimal settings for learning rate, batch size, and epochs.

### Model Evaluation
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: A metric for evaluating the quality of text generation, especially useful in translation tasks.
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: A set of metrics for evaluating summarization and text generation by comparing overlaps with reference outputs.

### Model Interpretability
- **SHAP**: Using SHAP to interpret model predictions, providing insights into the contribution of each feature to the output, ensuring model transparency and trustworthiness.

### Deployment
- **Gradio**: Creating an interactive web interface using Gradio, enabling users to interact with the model in real-time, generating text based on user input and displaying results instantly.
