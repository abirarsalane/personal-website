I had the privilege of living it on October 17th, 2023, as we celebrated the culmination of the Orange Summer Challenge 2023. This prestigious program brought together brilliant minds from 15 countries across the Orange Digital Centers network, uniting our collective vision to shape the future. üåç\nThis year, the Orange Summer Challenge revolved around the theme ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence and Internet of Things: A Winning Duo to Tackle the Challenges of Tomorrow!‚Äù It was an extraordinary opportunity to dive into cutting-edge technologies and harness their potential to make a lasting impact.\nThroughout this transformative journey, we were fortunate to be supported by a strong system provided by Orange , Amazon Web Services (AWS) and EY . The guidance, mentorship, and personalized training we received were instrumental in our growth and development. Our mission was clear: to foster innovation and create meaningful solutions in crucial areas.\nBut what truly made this experience exceptional was the amazing team I had the honor of working with. Their talent, ambition, and dedication were the driving forces behind our success. ‚ú®\nThe pitch At the heart of the challenge, I had the privilege of representing my team and pitching our project. Months of hard work, innovation, and unwavering dedication culminated in the unveiling of our project - Scia-tech, a revolutionary smart insole designed to seamlessly integrate into daily life.\nThe project Picture this: smart insoles that not only monitor your every move but also provide a unique solution for those dealing with sciatica. Our insoles go beyond tracking; they analyze your posture and behaviors to identify patterns that could lead to sciatica pain. What sets us apart is a cutting-edge recommendation system offering a personalized and unique user experience through a mobile app.\nWhy it matters Numbers don‚Äôt lie:\n+70% PATIENTS live with sciatica pain for more than 10 years. +1.2 BILLION ‚Ç¨ spent on sciatica related expenses. +8 MILLION people are affected by sciatica in Morocco only. +30% PATIENTS suffer from sciatica in the world. Daily Challenges:\nHigh prevalence of sciatica affecting a large population. Economic impact costing billions of euros annually in healthcare. Challenges in managing activities. Lack of personalized care. Mobility limitations. Solution Connected insoles that track the user‚Äôs daily activities using multiple sensors for the main purpose of pain prediction. Also providing instant feedback and correction recommandations.\nReal-time tracking of daily, weekly, and monthly activities. Predictive pain analysis. Personalized Recommendations. Daily, weekly and monthly reports. This is just the beginning, and I look forward to more opportunities to create meaningful change and to collaborate with remarkable individuals dedicated to shaping a better tomorrow. üåç\nTogether, we are making a real difference! üöÄ\nMore than just an AI Project Throughout this internship, I‚Äôve had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse range of individuals - from fellow interns and dedicated supervisors to mentors who have guided me every step of the way. This experience also opened doors for me to interact with top-level directors and even the government minister of Economic Inclusion, Small Business, Employment and Skills Mr. Sekkouri Youness, allowing me to pitch in front of a diverse and influential audience, and pushing me to grow and expand my horizons in unexpected ways.\nBut it‚Äôs not just about the positions and titles; it‚Äôs about the people and their talents. Working alongside these gifted individuals, I‚Äôve not only learned and honed my skills but also had the pleasure of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the industry.\nHowever, the beauty of this internship extends beyond the workplace. It‚Äôs also about forging genuine connections and building meaningful relationships. Beyond projects and tasks, I‚Äôve been fortunate to connect with amazing individuals and create lasting friendships. It‚Äôs a testament to the fact that professional growth is intrinsically tied to the people you meet and the experiences you share.\nI‚Äôm excited about the future and the potential opportunities that lie ahead, all thanks to the foundation I‚Äôve built during my time at Orange. I look forward to staying connected and continuing to grow both professionally and personally.\nHere‚Äôs to the wonderful journey of growth, learning, and friendship! üôå\nFor curious Minds If you‚Äôre interested in the project, visit it‚Äôs website and/or go to ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô in this portfolio.
